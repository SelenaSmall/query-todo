Get started with JS
This tutorial was written using Mac OS and Sublime Text 3 as the text editor. It assumes you have configured your local server to read project directories in either /Sites or another location on your machine and that you have a sound understanding on html and css concepts.

1. Create a project root folder, the the purpose of this exercise I will name this folder “javascript”

2. Create 3 files in your project root: index.html		script.js		style.css
	*file structure pic

3. If you want to store your project on github or another git service (which is recommended to keep track of your projects), set that up now.

4. Inside the index.html set up your structure with links to the other files
	<!DOCTYPE html> 
	<html> 
		 <head> 
			 <title>Learning Javascript</title> 
			 <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.2.4/jquery.min.js"></script>
			 <link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' href='style.css'/> 
			 <script type='text/javascript' src='script.js'></script> 
		 </head> 
		 <body> 
			 <h1>Learning Javascript</h1> 
		 </body> 
	</html>

5. You can test this out by opening a web browser and navigating to your localhost, in this case http://localhost/javascript/ - On the screen you should see the heading output that was specified in the index.html file “Learning jQuery"

6. In the style.css you can add styling to your elements as usual, lets change the styling on the <h2> tag and make it red
	h2 {
		color: red; 
	}

7. In the script.js you can now get your document ready to perform some jQuery tasks by declaring the document.ready function:
	$(document).ready(function() {

	});
